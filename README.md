# WeDesign Workshop

This workshop is the perfect introduction to rapid prototyping your ideas from day-1. You will learn how to use the right tools to go from low to high fidelity designs and validate your ideas without investing much time and money.

You will have the opportunity take your idea from hand sketching to wireframing then to interactive prototypes. It is one of the fastest and cheapest ways to test a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before jumping into expensive unvalidated development.

By the end of the workshop, you will have a good understanding of the important role an UX Designer plays within a startup and larger organizations. Better yet, you will leave with a finished prototype that you can test and iterate with potential users.
